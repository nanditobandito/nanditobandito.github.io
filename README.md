# Predicting Student Performance to Forecast University Enrollment

Not all universities have dedicated registrar departments, nor access to specific software to keep track of student enrollment to forecast future enrollment.  The ability to develop reliable student forecast brings multiple benefits in regard to both university finances and student investment. This study explores prior student data from the Institution Tecnologico de Chihuahua (ITCH), with the intent to develop such forecast models. This is achieved through an ensemble of different predictive models such as a Support Vector Machine (SVM) binary classification, ordinary least squares linear regression (OLS), and Holt-Winter Exponential Smoothing.
